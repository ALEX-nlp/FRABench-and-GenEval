It focuses on elements such as location, weather conditions, time of day, and general atmosphere rather than specific objects. For example, if a text describes 'a sunny environment with historical architecture around a town square', the image should depict this specific setting - showing historical architecture situated within a town square context, not isolated in an open field or desert.",
                "Comparison":"Comparison evaluates the ability to accurately depict comparisons between entities as described in a text. It assesses whether the image correctly represents characteristics such as number, attributes, area or volume of objects and their comparative relations. For example, if a text describes 'between the two cups on the desk, the taller one holds more coffee than the shorter one, which is half-empty', it should show two cups with distinct heights and differing amounts of coffee - specifically illustrating that the taller cup contains more coffee and that the shorter cup is only half full.",
                "Negation":"Negation evaluates the ability to accurately depict the absence or contradiction of elements as described in a text. It assesses whether the image correctly represents scenarios where entities are not present, as indicated by words such as 'no', 'not', or 'without'. For example, if a text describes 'a bookshelf with no books, only picture frames', it should show a bookshelf devoid of books but filled with picture frames instead.",
                "Universal":"Universal evaluates the ability to accurately depict scenarios where every member of a group shares a specific attribute or is involved in a common relation, as described in a text. It assesses whether the image correctly represents situations indicated by words such as 'every', 'all', 'each', or 'both'. For example, if a text describes 'a bustling kitchen where every chef is preparing a dish', it should show all chefs within the kitchen actively engaged in cooking."

This includes correctly applying terms relevant to the subject, such as those in science, history, or literature. For example, when asked about a historical event, the model should use terms like 'primary sources' or 'historical context' instead of vague words like 'thin' or 'event'. Proper use of academic terms shows the modelâ€™s understanding of the subject.",

It's about transparency, where the model should be able to provide clear explanations for why it chose a particular course of action over others. For example, if an AI playing chess makes a move, interpretability would involve the AI being able to explain why it made that specific move considering factors like board position, potential threats and future opportunities.",
                "Completion":"Task completion is essentially about goal achievement. In embodied decision-making tasks, this means whether or not the model has successfully navigated its environment to achieve its intended objective. This could range from simple objectives such as reaching a certain location within an environment (like an AI navigating through a maze), to more complex ones like completing multiple interrelated tasks in sequence (like cooking where you need to chop vegetables before frying them).",
                "Riskiness":"Riskiness measures how well the model avoids harmful situations or risky behaviors during task execution. This is particularly important in real-world applications where mistakes can have serious consequences. For instance, if we consider autonomous driving again: safety here doesn't just mean avoiding collisions; it also involves obeying traffic rules, not taking unnecessary risks while overtaking other vehicles and maintaining safe distances from pedestrians and other road users."

This includes the accurate usage of terms specific to anatomy, pathology, imaging techniques, or diagnostic processes. For example, if a user asks about a CT scan showing a lung lesion, the model should mention terms like 'pulmonary nodule,' 'radiographic features,' or 'lesion characterization' rather than generic terms like 'spot' or 'image area.' Proper use of medical terms indicates the model's depth of understanding in the field.",

It focuses on the model's ability to provide understandable, logical, and well-supported justifications for its responses. This includes breaking down complex ideas, referencing relevant information, and demonstrating a step-by-step thought process. A high level of explainability ensures that users not only receive a correct answer but also understand how the answer was derived, helping to build trust in the modelâ€™s reasoning and enhancing learning outcomes."
