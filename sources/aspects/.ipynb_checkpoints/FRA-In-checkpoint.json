                "Shape Alignment":"This criterion evaluates how accurately the shapes described in the text correspond to the shapes of objects in the image, based solely on the text’s shape descriptors, or whether the shape of the objects conforms to realistic shape. The text may include common shape terms such as square, round, rectangular, oval, triangular, cubic, cylindrical, spherical, and other basic or specialized shapes like pyramidal, conical, pentagonal, teardrop, crescent, and diamond.",
                "Texture Alignment":"This criterion evaluates how accurately the textures described in the text are reflected in the image, based solely on the text description, or whether the textures of the objects conform to realistic textures. It includes surface qualities such as smoothness, roughness, or granularity, as well as material types like wood, plastic, and rubber. Additionally, it may encompass tactile sensations or patterns, such as silky, polished, or other material-based descriptions. The accuracy of the texture description is assessed by comparing the textual description to the actual appearance and surface properties of the objects in the image.",
                "Attribute Alignment":"Attribute Alignment assesses how well the attributes (such as color, texture, size, and shape) of objects described in the text are reflected in the image. It ensures that key features like color and size match what’s described. For instance, if the text says “a green bicycle,” the image should show a bicycle that is green. It also checks if details like texture and shape are accurate, like a “smooth, red ball” being depicted as both smooth and red. Furthermore, the relative size and proportions of objects should be consistent with the description. Overall, the image should visually match the text’s description of each object's attributes."

                "Spatial Alignment":"This criterion measures how accurately the spatial relationships between objects in the generated output match the descriptions in the text. It evaluates whether the relative positions, orientations (up, down, left, right), and arrangements of objects align with the textual description. For example, if the text mentions a chair to the left of a table, the image should show the chair on the left side of the table, and if a person is sitting on a chair in front of a table, this relationship should also be reflected accurately in the image.",
                "Action Alignment":"Action Alignment evaluates how accurately the actions or interactions described in the text are represented in the image. It specifically measures dynamic actions like 'running', 'talking', or 'holding', and does not consider static descriptions or spatial relationships (e.g., left, right, or object arrangements). For example, if the text says 'a dog running after a ball', the image should show the dog running after the ball.",
                "Count Alignment":"Count Alignment evaluates how accurately the number of objects described in the text matches both the number and type of objects presented in the corresponding image. It specifically measures whether the quantity of objects mentioned in the text (e.g., two dogs, three cars, or five apples) is correctly reflected in the image, and ensures that the objects shown are of the correct type. For example, if the text mentions 'two dogs', the image should contain two dogs, not two cats. This evaluation focuses solely on the count and type of objects, without considering their attributes or positions.",
                "Object Relationship":"Object Relationship evaluates how accurately the spatial relationships and actions between objects described in the text are represented in the image. It focuses on whether the interactions, positions, and movements of objects in the image match those described in the text. For example, in the description 'a person standing next to a table and reaching for a book', the image should show the person next to the table with their hand extended toward the book. As long as the spatial relationships and actions are correctly represented, the image will be considered accurate.",
                "Object Alignment":"Object Alignment evaluates how accurately the objects described in a text are represented in an image. The objects mentioned in the text should be accurately presented in the image, with no omissions. For example, in the description ' A man sitting by himself at the dinner table', the image should feature both a man and a dinner table to achieve a high score. Missing or extra objects in the image would lower the score.",
                "Color Alignment":"This criterion assesses whether the colors described in the text match the corresponding objects in the image based solely on the text description. If the text specifies the color of an object, the evaluation checks whether the image reflects that color. For example, if the text says 'a blue car', the image should show a car that matches the described color, not one of a different color."

The model should accurately implement the specified changes, including adjusting colors, shapes, positions, and adding or removing elements as instructed. This includes adhering to any quantity or specific attribute requirements described in the text. For example, if the text requests 'add one small white dog', the image should show exactly one small white dog. If the model generates two white dogs, or a black dog instead, the accuracy evaluation should be poor."
